# Module 4: Iteration, Generators, and Real-Time Audio

## Overview
In Module 4, you'll learn how to leverage Pythonâ€™s iterators and generators for efficient, real-time audio processing. This module covers techniques for continuous data streaming and custom iterator implementations.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Iterators and Generators for Streaming Audio
- Understanding Python's iterator protocol.
- Building generators to simulate continuous audio streams.

### Lesson 2: Custom Iterators for DSP Operations
- Creating custom iterator classes (e.g., for moving average filters).
- Integrating custom iterators into real-time processing pipelines.

## Project: Real-Time Audio Stream Generator
Develop a generator-based solution that simulates a continuous audio stream and applies a moving average filter for smoothing the signal.
