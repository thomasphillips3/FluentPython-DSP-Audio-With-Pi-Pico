# Module 3: Object-Oriented DSP Design

## Overview
Module 3 focuses on applying object-oriented principles to digital signal processing. By encapsulating DSP logic within classes, youâ€™ll build reusable and extensible audio components.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Building Audio Components with Classes
- Designing classes for audio generation and processing.
- Encapsulating hardware control within class methods.

### Lesson 2: Audio Synthesizer Class
- Creating a class that generates various waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth).
- Implementing modulation techniques for dynamic sound.

### Lesson 3: Operator Overloading and Signal Mixing
- Overloading operators to simplify the mixing of audio signals.
- Developing an intuitive audio mixer object.

## Project: Audio Synthesizer and Mixer
Develop a class-based synthesizer that allows for waveform selection and modulation, integrated with an audio mixer for combining multiple sources.
