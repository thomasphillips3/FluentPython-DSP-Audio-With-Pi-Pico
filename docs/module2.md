# Module 2: Working with Audio Data

## Overview
Module 2 dives into the management and manipulation of audio data using Python’s advanced data structures and functional programming techniques. You’ll build the foundations for creating dynamic and modular audio effects.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Advanced Data Structures for Audio
- Using Python's lists, arrays, and memoryviews for handling audio buffers.
- Techniques for efficient storage and manipulation of digital audio.

### Lesson 2: Functions as First-Class Objects in DSP
- Implementing audio effects as functions.
- Higher-order functions and callbacks for modular DSP design.

### Lesson 3: Modular Audio Effects Pipeline
- Composing multiple audio effects (e.g., echo, reverb) into a cohesive pipeline.
- Testing and combining effects in real-time.

## Project: Modular Audio Effects Pipeline
Create a pipeline that processes audio data through a series of effects. Each effect should be implemented as a separate function to demonstrate modular and reusable code.
