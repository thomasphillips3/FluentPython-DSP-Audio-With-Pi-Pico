# Module 7: Capstone Project

## Overview
Module 7 is the capstone of the curriculum, where you integrate all the concepts learned into a comprehensive audio processing system. This final project challenges you to combine multiple DSP modules into a unified, multi-effect processor with a user interface.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Planning the Capstone Project
- Defining project requirements and specifications.
- Designing the overall system architecture.

### Lesson 2: Implementing the Multi-Effect Processor
- Integrating multiple DSP modules (synthesizer, filters, effects).
- Managing real-time processing and data flow.

### Lesson 3: User Interface Integration
- Developing a physical or web-based interface to control audio effects.
- Testing and refining the complete system.

## Project: Multi-Effect Audio Processor
Build a capstone project that combines various DSP modules into one cohesive system. Demonstrate your ability to integrate advanced Python techniques, hardware interfacing, and real-time audio processing.
