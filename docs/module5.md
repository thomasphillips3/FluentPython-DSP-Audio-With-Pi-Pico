# Module 5: Concurrency & Wireless Audio

## Overview
Module 5 introduces asynchronous programming and the wireless capabilities of the Pico 2W. Learn how to handle concurrent audio tasks and build IoT solutions for real-time audio streaming.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Asynchronous Audio Processing
- Using Python’s async/await syntax for concurrent processing.
- Managing simultaneous audio capture, processing, and output.

### Lesson 2: Wireless Audio with the Pico 2W
- Leveraging the Pico 2W’s WiFi features for audio transmission.
- Integrating networking code with DSP pipelines.

## Project: IoT Audio Streamer
Create an audio streamer that captures audio, processes it asynchronously, and transmits it over WiFi to a remote device.
