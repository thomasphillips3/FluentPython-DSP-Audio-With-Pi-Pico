# Module 6: Metaprogramming & Extending DSP Framework

## Overview
Module 6 explores dynamic programming techniques in Python. Learn how to use decorators, metaprogramming, and plugin architectures to extend your DSP framework in a flexible, scalable manner.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Dynamic Audio Effects with Decorators
- Using decorators to add logging, parameter control, and dynamic behavior to audio processing functions.
- Enhancing DSP modules without modifying core logic.

### Lesson 2: Plugin Architecture for Audio Effects
- Designing a system to support the dynamic addition of new audio effects.
- Implementing a plugin registration and loading mechanism.

## Project: Audio Effects Plugin System
Develop a plugin system that allows for dynamic loading and execution of custom audio effects. This system should be modular and easy to extend.
