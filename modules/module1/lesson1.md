# Lesson 1: Setting Up the Pico & Digital Audio Primer

In this lesson, we focused on getting the Pico ready for our projects and reviewed key digital audio concepts. We set up MicroPython on the Pico, uploaded our code using tools like `mpremote`, and verified our PWM output using both serial prints and an oscilloscope.

## PWM Duty Cycle Explanation

**Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)** is a technique used to simulate analog output using digital signals. It rapidly turns the output on and off at a fixed frequency. By varying the proportion of time that the signal is **on** versus **off**, PWM can control the effective power delivered to a device such as a motor, LED, or speaker.

### Duty Cycle

The **duty cycle** is the percentage of one complete cycle during which the signal is active (i.e., "on"). It is calculated as:

**Duty Cycle (%)** = (Time On / Total Period) Ã— 100

For example:
- **50% duty cycle**: The signal is on for half the period and off for the other half.
- **100% duty cycle**: The signal is always on.
- **0% duty cycle**: The signal is always off.

### Why It Matters

By adjusting the duty cycle, you control the average voltage or power delivered by the PWM signal. For instance, when controlling an LED, a higher duty cycle results in a brighter LED because it receives more power over time.

### Application in Our Code

In our sine wave generator project, the PWM duty cycle is modulated by a sine function:
- The pulse width (time the signal is high) changes over time according to the sine wave.
- When observed on an oscilloscope, this modulation creates a waveform that approximates a sine wave.
- The calculated duty cycle is mapped to a range (0 to 65535) suitable for the Pico's PWM hardware.

## Learnings from This Lesson

- **Digital Audio Concepts:**  
  - Reviewed analog-to-digital conversion, waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth), frequency, amplitude, and how they translate into digital signals.
  
- **PWM & Duty Cycle:**  
  - Understood how PWM works and why the duty cycle is crucial for controlling power output.
  - Learned how to map a computed sine wave value to a PWM duty cycle range.

- **File Upload in MicroPython:**  
  - Discovered that unlike CircuitPython, MicroPython requires tools such as `mpremote`, `ampy`, or `rshell` to upload files.
  
- **Verification Techniques:**  
  - Verified our PWM output using both serial prints (to monitor duty cycle values) and an oscilloscope (to visualize the waveform).

## Oscilloscope Capture
